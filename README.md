# Klish Project

## About

The klish is a framework for implementing a CISCO-like CLI on a UNIX systems.

NOTE: It's a development branch for fully rewritten klish version 3.
It's not functional for now.
For stable klish version 2 see the "2.2" branch.

The main target for the klish is a Linux platform.


## Build

NOTE:
You need branch "master" for development non-stable version.
You need branch "2.2" for stable version.

The development master branch needs libfaux (http://faux.libcode.org) to be built.
The stable branch 2.2 doesn't need libfaux library.
